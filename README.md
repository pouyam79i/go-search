# Project Overview
I am creating a search command to be able to analize files. This is a practical project to learn go lang.<br>
To build this command I will use 'cobra' pkg.

# How to install it!
Zere step is to download a go compiler :)<br><br>

First you shoud download 'cobra' and 'viper'. you can do that by using these commands:

    go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/
    go get -u github.com/spf13/viper/

Second step is to install the command. To do that, run the following command in 'search' directory:

    go install search

# How to use it
To find out how it works you can run following command in a cmd:

    search help
